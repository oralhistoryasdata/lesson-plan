The first step in this process it to copy a GitHub repository so you can use it on your own account. You can serve the website from your personal account, or you can create an organization to serve the website from a specific website. If you'd like to work on this , see GitHub's instructions on [Creating and Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)

## Use This Template! (Make a copy of this template!)

- Go to the [Oral History as Data GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oralhistoryasdata/oralhistoryasdata.github.io){:target="_blank"} and click on the green "Use this template" button toward the top right of the page.

- Name your repository.
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/name_repository.png" caption="" alt="image of the field users must fill out in order to create a name for their new template" class="w-50" %}

- Click the "Create Repository From Template" button -- this will copy all the files (but not the history!) of the Oral History as Data repository into your own repository.

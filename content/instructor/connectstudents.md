{% capture gitnote %}If you'd like your students to learn more about Git and GitHub beyond the basic interactions we assign here, please assign them our [Git/GitHub Learning Module](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github/blob/main/intro-github.md) as part of this assignment. The assignment or class exercise will take about 30 minutes. {% endcapture %}

In order for the students to have access to the repository, you must go into the "Settings" of your respository online and invite each student as a collaborator. 

Before you're able to do that, you will need to have your students do two things. 

1. Sign Up for a GitHub Account by following these directions: 
    - Go to <https://github.com/>.
    - Create an account.
    - Check their email to find an email message with a link that will let them verify their account.

2. Sending you their usernames. 

After you have their usernames: 

- Go to the Settings section of your repository. 
- Click the "Collaborators and teams" menu item on the left in the Access submenu. 
- Click the green "Add People" button on the right side of the page. 
- Enter your each student's username and click "Write" access. 

Unfortunately, you'll have to do this for each student so it's a bit repetive. 

After you've added the students, make sure to let them know they will be receiving an email from GitHub that asks them to accept the invitation to collaborate to the repository. They will need to: 

- Click the link provided in that email
- Sign into GitHub and 
- Accept the invitation. 

After that, they'll be able to upload the files they create for their transcripts into the repository.

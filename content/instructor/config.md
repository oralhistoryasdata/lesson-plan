The config file for a Oral History as Data website is title `_config.yml`. 


- First, find the *_config.yml* file in your base directory, which is the directory that opens when you first open the repository in github.  
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/configscreen.png" caption="image of _config.yml file found on main page of repository" alt="image of config folder" class="w-50" %}

- Once you open up the folder, you'll need to edit the file. Click on the pencil icon at the top right corner of the page to edit the file. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/edit_pencil.png" caption="" alt="image of config folder" class="w-50" %}

- Then edit the Site Settings at the top of the file to reflect your project. Any line that does not start with a `#` is a variable you can edit. If you don't want organization Links and logos, either add a `#` to the beginning of that line or delete the line entirely.

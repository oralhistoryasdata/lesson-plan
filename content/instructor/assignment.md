## Oral History as Data Assignment Description

Oral histories provide crucial primary sources for historians. These interactions—and the recordings and transcripts that remain—offer historians the opportunity to understand how people experienced the past and choose to remember it. Rather than offering a “what really happened” account, these sources often provide greater context about people’s memories of an event, person, or era. 

Oral histories are troublesome documents as well. They are influenced by the questions of the collector. They are shaped by time, distance, and a desire to remember things a certain way. It is important when you collect these texts that you keep these factors in mind, even as we acknowledge that all of this is part of the collaborative process. 

Oral historians have been aided in making the stories they collect public through the expansion of the Digital Humanities. As our Digital Librarian Olivia Wikle notes, “Digital Humanities can be defined as the process of utilizing technology to ask (and answer) traditional humanities questions in new ways.” Digital History “can range from asking traditional humanities-oriented questions about digital media and computing technologies, to using computational tools and methods to investigate historical data.”

This course will provide you the opportunity to gain training in both public history and digital history as we undertake a collective oral history DH project. You will be asked to do the work that historians do—interviewing, coding, tagging, uploading, and writing an analytical essay. 

Below is a description of each step of this assignment: 

1. Oral History Training: 
    1. Please familiarize yourself with the Oral History Association’s [Best Practices](https://www.oralhistory.org/about/principles-and-practices-revised-2009/).

    6. Conduct the interview following OHA’s best practices. Interviews can be free flowing but limit your interview to 30 minutes to 1 hour. 

3. Transcribe Interview: 
    7. You can do transcription by hand or find a free online transcription software (please note that even the best software cannot produce pristine transcriptions). These do not need to be verbatim (ummms, ahhs may be omitted).

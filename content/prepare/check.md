## Step 5: Check for Errors

- There is likely to be some text that accidentally got separated out to extra columns. To easily find this, select the entire spreadsheet so it's highlighted in blue

- Click on `Format` > `Text wrapping` > `Clip`

{% include figure.html img="/prep/transcript6.png" caption="Format > Text wrapping > Clip" alt="a screenshot of pasting text in google sheets" width="100%" %}

- Now you can see text that should be in the `words` column:

{% include figure.html img="/prep/transcript7.png" caption="Rogue Text" alt="a screenshot of pasting text in google sheets" width="100%" %}

- Copy and paste this text back into the appropriate `words` cells (you'll likely need to refer back to the Google Doc version of the transcript to verify that you're putting it in the right place)

- When this text is cleaned up, change the formatting to "Wrap" by selecting the entire spreadsheet again and clicking `Format` > `Text wrapping` > `Wrap`.

- Expand column C (the `words` column) so you can comfortably read the text. Your transcript should now look something like this:

{% include figure.html img="/prep/transcript8.png" caption="Transcript" alt="a screenshot of pasting text in google sheets" width="100%" %}

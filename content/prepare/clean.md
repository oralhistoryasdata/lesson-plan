## Step 2: Clean Your Transcript 

We clean text before we use it in order to stave off later problems. Smart quotes, single character ellipses, and other artifacts won't render correctly on the web so it's best to clean your text before you transform it for the tool. 

Microsoft Word and Excel both add additional encoded characters (some of which are invisible!!) that will lead an application like ours to crash or that will cause web pages to render text incorrectly. 

Cleaner text also enables easier transfer between formats. By using the forms below, your text should should also be put in a format that is easier to nicely paste into a spreadsheet. 

So please clean your transcript by pasting your transcript in the upper form and pushing the clean button below the lower form: 

{% include wordcleaner.html%}


- Copy the clean version of your transcript from the bottom form by selecting all the text in the form: 
    - Click into the form. 
    - Push CTRL+A on your keyboard to select all of the text in the from. (You will see the contents become highlighted)
    - Push CTRL+C to copy the text to your clipboard. 
- You will paste your clean transcript into the blank transcript starter in the next step.

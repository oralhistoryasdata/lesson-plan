## Step 1: Copy the Spreadsheet Template


- Here is a [Blank Transcript Starter Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWrPMItiP-XOSkm7gyC8b9bl3tpSQRj9zLzS5y8QnW0/copy){:target="_blank"} to help you get started. 
- Make a copy of the template by clicking on the link above and then clicking the "Make a Copy" button. 
- Give your transcript a simple name, preferably `lastname_firstname` (i.e. `doe_jane`). 
- For naming this and other files: 
    - do not use spaces 
    - use only lower case characters for the file name and the extension
    - do not use special characters like: `?`, `%`, `#`, `/`,`:`,`,` and `â€˜`  
    - for more characters to avoid and general rules, see [here](https://support.promax.com/en/knowledge/special-characters)
- Go to the next step by clicking the button on the right below. We will use this blank template in step 3. 
{% include bootstrap/alert.md text="It's less important to get the naming exactly in the Google Sheet now, as you'll need to rename the spreadsheet later when you download it as a CSV file. But it's good practice to follow these conventions." %}

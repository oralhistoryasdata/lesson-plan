## Step 3: Paste Your Transcript Into Google Sheets

- Go to your blank transcript template (now renamed!). 

- Click on the cell underneath `speaker` 

- Press CTRL+V on your keyboard to paste the contents of your clean transcript into the spreadsheet. 

- This should paste all the transcript text into the rows of the second column

- Alternatively, if you're using a Google Doc of your transcript: 
    - Open your transcript as a Google Doc
    - Copy all of the text of the transcript
    - Switch back to the Google Sheet you created
    - Click on the cell underneath `speaker` 
    - Click on `Edit` > `Paste Special` > `Paste Values Only`

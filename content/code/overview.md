Now that you have your transcript in spreadsheet form (oral history as data!), you can code the various sections of the interview by the topics that you cover. 

This section will walk you through the steps needed to code your transcript with the tags that will create the visualization and browsing possibilities enabled by the Oral History as Data tool. 

**Goals**: 

- Learn how to code your interview by subject 
- Learn how to copy and paste spreadsheet cells in chunks using the mouse. 
- Learn the importance of attention to detail when it comes to file naming conventions

**Estimated Time to Complete**: ~1 Hour (but this depends on the length of the interview)

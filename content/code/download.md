## Step 4: Download Your Transcript Spreadsheet as a CSV

{% include youtube/embed.html  video-id="FAQmA-RWCvQ " title="Downloading Transcript as CSV" display="d-none d-md-block" %}
- Once you've edited the Google Sheet and gotten everything in order, go to the "file" tab at the top of your sheet and hover over "download"
- Select "comma-separated values"  to save your file as a .csv file

- Once downloaded, rename your transcript so that's it follows the file naming practices we went over in the first section of this lesson. 
    - We typically use either just the last name, for small collections, or `lastname_firstname`, for larger collections. 
    - If you named your spreadsheet in section 1 of this lesson using the correct conventions, you'll still need to delete the extra sheet information in the downloaded file. 
        - e.g. If your spreadsheet was called doe_jane, it will download as `doe_jane - Sheet 1.csv` --> Change that to just `doe_jane.csv`
    - The filename of your transcript will be connected with the page being produced in the next section, so it's a really important piece for making everything work!

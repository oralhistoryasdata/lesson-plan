In order to publish your transcript on the website, you will need to go through two steps. 

1. Get a GitHub account. 
    - Go to <https://github.com/>.
    - Create an account.
    - Check your email to find an email message with a link that will let you verify your account.

2. Get permission to contribute to the class repository. 
    - Send your GitHub username to your instructor. 
    - Your instructor will invite you to be a contributor to the repository. 
    - ***You will need to accept the email invitation to be able to contribute! Look for the email!***

Once those steps are accomplished, you'll be able to upload your transcript and create your markdown page. 

#### A Note on GitHub

GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git to track file changes. It also provides an excellent ability to publish websites for free. For this project, your interactions with GitHub will be fairly simple -- you'll only be uploading your transcripts and creating a page stub. But there are many more possibilities for the platform.
